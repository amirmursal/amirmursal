### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Amir Mursal**, a Front End Developer with about **10 + years of experience** in front-end development, I specialize in ReactJS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I have worked extensively across multiple domains including Health, Learning, and Media applications, delivering user-centric solutions that are both scalable and performant.

Iâ€™m passionate about implementing accessibility best practices (WCAG, ARIA) to create inclusive digital experiences. Skilled in detecting and resolving accessibility issues using tools such as axe, NVDA, and browser DevTools, I actively champion accessibility compliance and usability improvements within teams.

My expertise also extends to open-source UI development and DevOps CI/CD pipelines, with practical experience leveraging GitHub Actions and Azure for streamlined deployment and continuous integration.

I thrive in cross-functional collaboration, working closely with developers, product owners, business analysts, and engineering managers to deliver high-quality software. Known for strong analytical thinking, thorough documentation, and effective defect management, I focus on solution-driven approaches to achieve impactful results.

- ðŸŽ¯ **Why I Love Coding and Building**: For me, coding is the closest thing to magicâ€”turning ideas into reality, one line at a time. I love building because itâ€™s creative, logical, and endlessly challenging. Whether itâ€™s solving a complex problem or crafting a smooth user experience, I get a real sense of purpose from creating things that work, help, and inspire..
